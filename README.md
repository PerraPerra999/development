# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of the application was to allow users to purchase characters from a video game called League of Legends. Every character belongs to a certain class and has a price. 

### Usability Principles Considered

The user can add "champions" to their cart (only once) and remove them with a button. They can also use a variety of filters to filter through the champions based on class, price, and attack type.

### Organization of Components

There's a separate component called filter that includes all the functionality of the applicaiton. Each component has its own css file.

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

Each component is exported and imported across other components. They are embedded other components using functions.

### How the User Triggers State Changes

The user triggers state changes by adding items to cart, filtering the items, and removing items from cart.
